### 🧠 My Origin Story
Once upon a time, a young dev asked:
> “What if I dockerize *everything*?”

The rest was YAML and regret.

Now I build things that (usually) work — powered by **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, and occasional chaos.

`NestJS` ⚡ `Next.js` ⚙️ `PostgreSQL` 🧩 `Docker` 🧠 `Redis` 🔥 `TypeORM`  
Also trying to **understand Rust** before Rust understands me.

### 🪄 My Toolkit
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 🧠 Obsidian | To store thoughts before they escape |
| 🧑‍🚀 Neovim | When I feel like a hacker |
| 💻 VSCode | When I remember I’m human |
| 🪄 Yarn / pnpm | Because npm felt too mainstream |
| ☕ Coffee | Dependency with no uninstall command |
